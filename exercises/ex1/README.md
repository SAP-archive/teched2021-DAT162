# Exercise 1 - Getting a BTP Trial Account and Subscribing to MDG Cloud

In this exercise, you will create your own trial account on SAP BTP and subscribe to SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition.

If you already have a trial account on BTP, you can use your existing BTP trial account. Following the instructions will bring you to your existing BTP trial account in this case.

Furthermore, if you already have an active trial subscription to SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition, you can skip this entire exercise and continue with [exercise 2](../ex2/README.md).

**Your trial subscription of MDG Cloud remains valid for 30 days, so that you can continue exploring MDG Cloud after the workshop.** After this period you can delete the subscription and create a new subscription to start a new trial period. By deleting a subscription you will loose access to all data created.
