# Exercise 5 - Data Quality Management

With this exercise you explore some of the features for master data quality management offered by SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition (MDG Cloud). You will see how data quality rules for validation of master data are managed and how you can control their usage in master data processes. You will use the _Evaluation Results_ app to analyze the results of a data quality evaluation and see how you can fix detected errors.

## Exercise Description

This exercise is split in 3 parts. It is required to perform each step after the other. Please note that there is a detailed [step-by-step description](#step-by-step-description) provided below.

### Step 1 – Examine validation rules

Launch the app _Display Validation Rules_ and examine the example rules that are provided as part of your trial account. Please note that these are simple examples that were created for demonstration purposes. In the trial version you cannot edit these rules, examine their implementation in BRFplus or create new rules.

### Step 2 – Analyze the evaluation results of the rule _REGION_REQUIRED_

Navigate to the evaluation results of the rule _REGION_REQUIRED_. You can either click on the score of the rule to open the app _Evaluation Results_ with a filter applied for the rule. Alternatively, you can launch the app _Evaluation Results_ from the home page and manually filter for the rule.

### Step 3 – Correct the errors found for rule _REGION_REQUIRED_

Either click on the business partner for which the rule evaluation results in an error, then choose _Manage Business Partners – Central Governance_ to correct the business partner in a single request. Alternatively, you can select the erroneous business partner, plus further erroneous business partners that you might have created as part of this workshop. Having the business partners selected, you can process all of them in a mass request for fixing the errors.
