# DAT162 - Hands-On Experience on SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2021 session called DAT162 - Hands-On Experience on SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition.  

## Overview

In this session, you will learn in detail about the features of SAP MDG, cloud edition. You will get a hands-on understanding of capabilities like consolidation, central governance and data quality management for business partner master data. You will see how easy it is to set up and consume this Software-as-a-Service solution on the SAP Business Technology Platform.​

_Note:_ The trial account that you setup in exercise 1 remains valid after the workshop, so that you can continue exploring MDG Cloud.

## Requirements

It is helpful to have a trial account for SAP Business Technology Platform. But don't worry if you don't - it is part of the first exercise to create such an account.

## Exercises

This workshop is separated in multiple exercises. Ideally, you perform them all in sequence. You can skip exercise 1 in case you already have a subscription of MDG Cloud Trial. The other exercises could be done independent of each other. However, the data that you create in one exercise also serves as input for the following exercise.

- [Getting Started](exercises/ex0/)
- [Exercise 1 - Getting a BTP Trial Account and Subscribing to MDG Cloud](exercises/ex1/)
- [Exercise 2 - Central Governance](exercises/ex2/)
- [Exercise 3 - Consolidation](exercises/ex3/)
- [Exercise 4 - Mass Change](exercises/ex4/)
- [Exercise 5 - Data Quality Management](exercises/ex5/)
